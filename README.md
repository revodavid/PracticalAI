* [AI Live](https://live360events.com/Events/Orlando-2018/Sessions/Friday/AIF01-Workshop-Practical-Artificial-Intelligence-for-the-Working-Software-Engineer.aspx) (AIF01), Orlando, December 7 2018

## About these notebooks

This library includes three notebooks to support the workshop:

1. The AI behind Seeing AI. Use the web-interfaces to Cognitive Services to learn about the AI services behind the "Seeing AI" app
2. Computer Vision API with R. Use an R script to interact with the Computer Vision API and generate captions for random Wikimedia images.
3. Custom Vision with R. An R function to classify an image as a "Hot Dog" or "Not Hot Dog", using the Custom Vision service.
4. MNIST with scikit-learn. Use sckikit-learn to build a digit recognizer for the MNIST data using a regression model.
5. MNIST with tensorflow. Use Tensorflow (from Python) to build a digit recognizer for the MNIST data using a convolutional neural network.

These notebooks are hosted on Azure Notebooks at https://notebooks.azure.com/davidsmi/projects/practicalai?WT.mc_id=opensource-0000-davidsmi, where you can run them interactively. You can also download them to run them using Jupyter.

## Setup (for use in Azure Notebooks)

* Sign in to Azure Notebooks. You'll need a Microsoft Account: your O365, Xbox, or Hotmail account will work.

If you're new to Notebooks, check out the [Jupyter Notebook documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the [Azure Notebook documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notebooks/?WT.mc_id=opensource-0000-davidsmi).

* If you have an iPhone, install the free [SeeingAI app](https://www.microsoft.com/seeing-ai?WT.mc_id=opensource-0000-davidsmi).

* (optional) To generate keys and use Azure services, you'll need an Azure subscription. You can get a [free Azure account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?WT.mc_id=opensource-0000-davidsmi), with $200 in free credits for new subscribers. You'll need a credit card, but most of the things we'll use in this workshop will be free.
